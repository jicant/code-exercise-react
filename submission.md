# Submission Notes

These notes will be read by HubSpot developers. Drop us a line!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

I would have liked to: 

* Completed the last objects I couldn't quite fit in time to do: a "true" fuzzy search, custom styled multi checkbox dropdowns, 
* gone over the code and refactored into additional reusable components. 
* added a dark mode (based on system setting)
* added Jest for unit testing Javascript + written some tests
* added mixins to the SCSS to make it more dynamic and concise
* structured the CSS variables more strictly
* added Redux to manage state between the React components more efficiently
* added some subtle animations for a smoother user experience. 

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

* I did not manage to complete all the requirements for exercise 2, but I have commented the parts which are incomplete.
* I used BEM for the SCSS naming convention.
* I have updated all the dependencies in the original package.json and added a module tag to the index.html for the new version of Parcel to work

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I hope that despite not being able to complete all the objectives in time, this gives you an idea of what I can do. 

I made it a bit harder for myself as I chose to use React JS when I don't use this on a day to day basis (my current role uses Vue JS) 

Some general notes of things I changed around the build below:

* updated all the included dependencies
* added sass/scss to repo
* added module attr to script js (after updating parcel)
* added scss file to js import, for parcel to render
* added stylelint for scss error checking + package json script
* added autoprefixer to build
